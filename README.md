RustyXML
========

RustyXML is a namespace aware XML parser written in Rust.
Right now it provides a basic SAX-like API, and an ElementBuilder based on that.

The parser itself is derived from OFXMLParser as found in ObjFW
<https://webkeks.org/objfw/>.

The current limitations are:
* Incomplete error checking
* Unstable API

This project tracks Rust's master branch.
